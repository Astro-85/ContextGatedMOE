When people have asthma, their breathing passages can become inflamed, swelling up and filling with mucus. Emphysema is another lung disease that makes people short of breath. In people with asthma, inflamed airways become sensitive to smoke and dust, and as a result, the muscles of the airway can tighten up. All of these things make the passages narrow, so it's hard for air to move through.
